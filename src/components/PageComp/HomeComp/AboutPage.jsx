                Hello ðŸ™‹

                I am an undergraduate with a degree in computer science. 
                I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and make a positive impact on the world.

                With experience as a full-stack developer or software developer, 
                I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask, MongoDB, and SQL. 
                I am also interested in machine learning and AI, which is why I am currently learning it. 
                As a creative problem solver and team player, I am committed to delivering high-quality work and exceeding expectations. 
                I am always eager to learn, connect with other technologies and tools, and explore new opportunities for growth and development.
